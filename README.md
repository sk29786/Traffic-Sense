# Traffic Sense - High-Level Traffic Flow Analysis

## Overview
Traffic Sense is a Python project designed to analyze real-time traffic camera feeds and detect patterns in vehicle movement. It uses advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning to provide insights on traffic density, vehicle speed estimation, and congestion prediction. This project demonstrates high-level data processing, modeling, and visualization skills.

## Features
- Detects and tracks vehicles in video feeds using OpenCV
- Estimates traffic density and average vehicle speed
- Predicts congestion patterns using machine learning models
- Visualizes traffic flow trends with plots and heatmaps
- Scalable to multiple camera feeds simultaneously

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher  
Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sense.git
